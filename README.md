## About Me

I’m **Danish**, a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist from **Karachi, Pakistan**. I specialize in building intelligent systems using Python, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, data analysis tools such as pandas and NumPy, and computer vision applications with OpenCV.

I’m passionate about exploring **large language models (LLMs)**, computer vision, and creating practical AI solutions that solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in ML and software development, I enjoy designing and deploying projects that combine innovation with impact.  

Always eager to **learn, collaborate, and contribute** to exciting AI and software projects.
